### Documentation

This Shiny application is an interactive adaptation and continuation of Omics Notebook, originally developed at CNSB Boston. The original publication is *Omics Notebook: robust, reproducible, and flexible automated multiomics exploratory analysis and reporting*, DOI: [10.1093/bioadv/vbab024](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fbioadv%2Fvbab024). The github repository for the original Omics Notebook can be found at <https://github.com/cnsb-boston/Omics_Notebook>.
